This branch of McDonald's is located at Pune Satara Road. I found this place bit congested. Service was not that appropriate. The place itself wasn't clean with many messy tables. I had to reach out to cleaner to get it cleaned. Also, there was a problem with electricity when I visited this place. It got off more than 15-20  times which was very annoying in the night. I doubt they even have air conditioners at this place.

So, I would not prefer this branch of McDonald's though the food was good.

I ordered mc aloo tikki- the burger was tasty but the sauce was barely there, would have liked some more...and potato wedges (regular)- I had to wait extra 10 mins for these after I got the burger. The wedges were piping hot and the bigger one's were soft and soggy. There was almost no masala on them.
I also had asked for aloo chatpata naan..but it was not available in this outlet.

Visiting A Mall And Not Eating At The McDonalds sounds a bore. So we tried to sound cliche. Also to try the discontinued Filet-O-Fish Burger At Chennai Outlets.

Dishes Ordered —
1) Filet-O-Fish Meal ~ This Filet-O-Fish Burger is heaven. The Fish Pattice is just on point and the Fries With Coke Only Complement. Pick Of The EATOut.
2) Veg McPuff ~ Nicely Made Puff with usual Paneer and veggies stuff.
3) McEgg ~ The Pattice is like double cooked Hakf Boil Egg. Another Decent Burger.
4) McAloo Tikki ~ Very Fresh and essence of Aloo Tikki is also there.

Ambience ~ Usual McDonalds Type Set Up.
Worth For The Price ~ Worth it for the quantity.
Location Accessiblity ~ Is Located On Lower Ground Of Mall.
Service ~ Self Service.
Hygiene ~ Yes,it’s hygiene.
Washroom ~ Washroom is Of mall.

Overall -
I just went for The Filet-O-Fish Because I Love That.",Iam AK(Anaikomagan),Rated 4.0
